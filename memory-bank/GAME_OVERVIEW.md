# Game Overview

## Concept
A browser-based interactive novel similar to classic gamebooks like *Warlock of Firetop Mountain* and *Deathtrap Dungeon*. The game combines rich narrative storytelling with interactive choices, turn-based combat, and on-screen dice rolls to determine outcomes.

## Core Features
- **Interactive Narrative:** Branching story paths with engaging text displayed as a novel
- **Dynamic Turn-Based Combat:** Integrated combat sequences using dice roll mechanics
- **Dual-Pane UI:**
  - Left Pane: AI-generated illustrations reflecting the scene or character actions
  - Right Pane: Narrative text presented like a novel, with options at the bottom
- **Multimedia Integration:**
  - AI-Generated Art: Scene illustrations generated using services like Stable Diffusion
  - Sound Effects & Music: Audio effects and background music to enhance immersion
  - Voice-Overs: AI-generated narration and character dialogue
- **Interactivity & Replayability:** Story evolution based on player decisions

## Implementation Plan
- Using Twine as the core engine for the interactive fiction component
- Custom JavaScript extensions for dice rolling, combat, inventory, and sound systems
- Responsive HTML/CSS layout for the dual-pane UI
- Integration with external services for AI art and voice generation
