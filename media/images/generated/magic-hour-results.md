# Magic Hour API Integration Results

## Summary

After extensive testing, we've encountered several technical limitations when attempting to integrate the Magic Hour API for image generation:

1. **Environment variable access:** We successfully added the Magic Hour API key (`MAGIC_HOUR_API_KEY=mhk_live_1pFDyTr5CwSi6xHDjv9F7KIjaf8rbBjMj1GcwlmpZUlARtke8xLN8ZGbHci0fms6ZziqJtMY7T6XPZp7`) to the .env file, verified through direct file inspection and environment variable testing.

2. **Script execution issues:** We encountered significant difficulties with script execution, where scripts we created either weren't properly saved to disk or couldn't be executed by Node.js.

3. **Console output redirection:** Even when simple scripts executed, console output did not appear in the terminal, making debugging difficult.

4. **File operations working properly:** File creation and manipulation through JavaScript worked correctly, as evidenced by our test scripts creating log files successfully.

## Current Status

The placeholder images for The Ember Throne Chronicles are in place, with 25 pages and a title page. These can serve as a temporary solution until the technical issues with the Magic Hour API integration are resolved.

## Next Steps

1. The current placeholder images remain functional for development purposes.

2. When the technical limitations are addressed, we can revisit implementing a full Magic Hour API integration using the script structure we've developed.

3. The API key is properly set up in the environment, so once script execution issues are solved, the integration should be straightforward.

4. All prompts for the various pages are prepared and ready to be used when the technical issues are resolved.
